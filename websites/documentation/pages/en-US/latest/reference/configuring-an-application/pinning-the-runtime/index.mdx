# Pinning the runtime

To run your application in a deterministic way, pin the version of the wolkenkit runtime. For that, open the application's `package.json` file and set the `wolkenkit/runtime/version` property to the version that you want to use.

<p>
  E.g., to pin the runtime to version {props.version}, use the following code:
</p>

<Code language='json'>{`
"wolkenkit": {
  "runtime": {
    "version": "${props.version}"
  }
}
`}</Code>

<Hint type='warning'>

  **Be careful with latest**

  You can pin your application to the `latest` runtime, e.g. if you want to evaluate new features that have not yet been officially released. If you do so, please note that unexpected things may happen, and be sure to read [using the latest runtime](../../../guides/using-the-latest-runtime/overview/).
